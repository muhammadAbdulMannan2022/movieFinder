# Welcome to your Expo App üé¨

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [\`create-expo-app\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It integrates with [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to display movie data.

## üöÄ Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

2. **Create a \`.env\` file in the root of the project**

   This file should contain your TMDb API key using the following format:

   \`\`\`
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   \`\`\`

   > üí° _Do not commit your \`.env\` file to version control!_

3. **Start the app**

   \`\`\`bash
   npx expo start
   \`\`\`

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## üßº Reset to a Fresh Project

When you're ready to start fresh, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm run reset-project
\`\`\`

This command will:

- Move the starter code to the **app-example** directory
- Create a blank **app** directory to begin fresh development
